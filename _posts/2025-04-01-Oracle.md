title: Potential Oracle Cloud Breach and Security Measures Needed

TL;DR: A likely breach at Oracle's `login.us2.oraclecloud.com`. Despite all the evidences, the breach still requires independent verification and an "assume breach" stance to secure systems.

Security researchers (CloudSEK, Black Kite) challenge Oracle, suggesting impact on legacy/peripheral systems.

**Evidence:**

* Video/transcript (Rose87168): Claims of data downloaded from Oracle servers.

* Web archive screenshots.

* Hudson Rock CTO: Confirmed legitimacy of 10k records from the attacker (verified by two customers).

**Independent Investigations:**

* CloudSEK: [https://www.cloudsek.com/blog/the-biggest-supply-chain-hack-of-2025-6m-records-for-sale-exfiltrated-from-oracle-cloud-affecting-over-140k-tenants](https://www.cloudsek.com/blog/the-biggest-supply-chain-hack-of-2025-6m-records-for-sale-exfiltrated-from-oracle-cloud-affecting-over-140k-tenants)
* BleepingComputer: [https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-customers-confirm-data-stolen-in-alleged-cloud-breach-is-valid/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-customers-confirm-data-stolen-in-alleged-cloud-breach-is-valid/)

**Yeah, not everything here makes sense, to put it mildly**

Always Remember: Threat actors are shady.

* *Breach Scope:* Primarily `us2` (confirmed), possibly `em2` (X), affecting OAM/Fusion applications. A `google dork inurl:login.us2.oraclecloud.com` shows a large "suspected breach list" (~120,000 domains, including global giants). The silence from many (especially EU companies with disclosure obligations) is concerning.
* *Data Accuracy:* Claimed 140k domains reduced to \~120k after removing duplicates. Many are invalid, non-existent, or generic (1.com, google.com, linkedin.comâ€¦).
* *Threat Actor Profile:* Limited activity history, requests for decryption help, and outdated data raise doubts.
* *Verification Limitations:* Primarily CloudSEK/Hudson Rock. Despite video evidence, widespread confirmation from affected organizations is absent.

**Oracle's Response: Honestly, a huge disappointment. And it means a ton more work for us**

Oracle's delayed/absent investigation is deeply disappointing and creates a critical risk: **The threat actor may still have access to the environment.**This makes security decisions a total nightmare for sysadmin security teams, because:

* Password resets alone are insufficient. While MFA is essential, the priority must shift to comprehensive investigation and robust Incident Response (IR) planning, prepared for a potentially ongoing compromise.
* Compromised key files pose a significant threat to SAML SSO. Attackers may be able to forge authentication, thus demanding a thorough review of identity infrastructure and access controls.
* Re-keying SSO becomes a near-impossible task without transparency from Oracle. The lack of clarity means security teams cannot effectively assess the risk of attacker persistence, traditional remediation efforts like key rotation can be ineffective.

**What we can do for now:**

*Prioritized Recommendations (For US2-hosted Cloud Apps - Fusion, HCM, etc.)*

* *Immediate & Comprehensive Credential Action:*
    * Reset *all* SSO, LDAP, and related credentials (especially privileged accounts).
    * Regenerate SSO configurations.
    * Audit/revoke API tokens and certificates.
    * Monitor third party user activity (proxy/HTTP logs) for anomaly behavior.
    * Enforce MFA on your IdP for Oracle access.
    * Ensure IdP-brokered accounts are used (no local Oracle accounts).
      
* *SSO/OAuth2 Endpoint Control:*
    * Scan for/validate/decommission/reconfigure hardcoded/legacy OAuth2/SSO endpoint references.
      
* *KeyStore Security:*
    * Rotate keys, certificates, and trust stores (especially for legacy endpoints like `login[.]us2[.]oraclecloud[.]com`).
      
* *Incident Response Readiness:*
    * Develop/update/test incident response plans (simulation exercises).
 
* *Proactive Engagement:*
    * Demand transparency from Oracle.
    * Engage with cybersecurity communities.
